Using taxi rank data from Johannesberg to intelligently cluster data after cleaning and preprocessing.

Clean and preprocess geolocation data for clustering

Visualize geolocation data interactively using Python

Cluster this data ranging from simple to more advanced methods, and evaluate these clustering algorithms

    Basic exploratory data analysis and visualizations

    Visualizing geographical data in a more meaningful and interactive way

    Silhouette score for evaluating the strength of a clustering algorithm

    Applying K-Means to solve the problem

    Density-based clustering approaches,such as DBSCAN

    HDBSCAN, to loosen constraints of classical DBSCAN

    Addressing outliers classified by density-based models.
